Nullification reenacts the Gleaners by Millet in the light of contemporary society’s ordinary everyday lives of neurodivergent people. This artwork naturally sprung from my long-term moral dissatisfaction and confusion regarding the order in which the neurodiversity awareness movements have been taking. So far, the faces of celebrities who have dyslexia, ADHD, Asperger’s syndrome, or Tourette syndrome have been utilized and advertised to the public to show the surprising benefits of neurodivergent minds and their commonness around us. Similarly, activist movements have tried to communicate different conceptions and facets of neurodiversity, leaving the side effect of conceptualizing extreme positivity and extreme negativity about neurodivergent people. These complex systems that have cast a net – like a spider web – seem to capture and hold back the very ordinary lives of neurodivergent people. Beyond and beneath all these external forces and influences, however, there is a driving force that moves the very ordinary everyday lives of neurodivergent people, diagnosed or undiagnosed, around us.
